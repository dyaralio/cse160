Used github copilot for code refactoring and functionality for triangle/circle drawing

My initials (DY) are on the roof of the house

The "Awesomeness" additions I made were:
1. Adding an alpha slider that changes the opacity of the new shapes
2. Adding a coordinate display under the canvas that tells the user what the exact coordinates of their mouse are when hovering over the canvas
3. Added a background image to make the website look better
4. Centered canvas and controls so the website looks better and is easier to use
